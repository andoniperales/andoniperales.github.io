        I just published the site through Github Pages for the time being. This was originally 
        published as an eepsite on <a class="blog" href="https://geti2p.net/" target="_blank">I2P</a>, 
        though it was very shortlived.

        It's made entirely with HTML and CSS, no javascript. I still want to keep testing how 
        far I can take such a barebones approach to web design in terms of functionality and aesthetics
        without ever touching JS. More content will make its way into it in the near future. 
        Take this as a "hello world" of sorts.
